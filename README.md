An esp32 wifi based attandance system with biometric authentication and data will push into google sheets with the wifi

This project presents an “SMART ATTENDANCE FINGERPRINT
BASED AUTHENTICATION. To create a secure and automated
attendance system that captures and logs attendance data
using fingerprint recognition, and displays the data in an Excel
sheet for easy access and management.
In modern educational and corporate environments,
efficient and reliable attendance management is crucial. The
Smart Attendance- Based Authentication System leverages
biometric authentication and IoT technology to streamline
the attendance process, ensuring accuracy and security. This
system utilizes an ESP32-WROOM DA module as the core
microcontroller and an R307 fingerprint sensor for biometric
verification. Attendance data is securely recorded and
managed using GOOGLE sheets, providing an accessible and
organized database for administrators.
